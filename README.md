# Active Directory Lab

## Description
This repository contains a step by step walkthrough of how i created an Active Directory lab in Oracle VirtualBox. In this lab, I set up a virtual environment using Oracle VirtualBox with Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 ISOs, creating a Domain Controller with Active Directory, configuring network settings, and establishing a client VM connected to the domain for testing user logins. Running this lab has allowed me to gain hands-on experience with VirtualBox, Active Directory and Windows Networking.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b>
- <b>Oracle Virtualbox</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Server 2022</b>
- <b>Windows 11</b>

# Walkthrough:
## Downloaded Oracle VirtualBox
[Oracle Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

## Downloaded Server 2022 ISO file
[Server 2019](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-windows-server-2022.html)

## Downloaded Windows 11 ISO file
[Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11)

## Configured the first VM
First I configured the VM and named it "Domain Controller." Then I added two network adapters to the Domain Controller. One for the internet and one for for my VirtualBox internal network.

## Installed Server 2022
Then I powered on the VM, selected the Server 2022 ISO file, then installed it onto the VM.

## Assigned IP Addressing
Next I assigned IP addressing for the internal network. The external network already has an IP address from my home network, and the domain itself will serve as the default gateway.

##  Created a dedicated admin account
VM restarted so I logged in again, created an organizational unit named "ADMINS," then added my own dedicated admin account.

## Configured Client VM 
Created another VM named "Client 1" and installed Windows 11 on it. This will be on the internal network so it can get its addressing from the Domain Controller
